## Multiplayer Third Person Shooter

I'm making this project for my Applied Research Project Course at Douglas College.

This project uses the MultiplayerSession Plugin I made which alone can be found in the MenuSystem repo.

## Important

1. To Test Multiplayer every tester needs to have Steam open, with a different Steam account.
2. To be able to find the game session, click settings > downloads > download region, and make sure machines have the same region (Mine is Canada - Vancouver)

This project cannot be compiled from source code alone. This is only for me to track my progress and back up my code. The complete projet is over 15GB including all assets used.
