## Multiplayer Third Person Shooter

This project uses the MultiplayerSession Plugin I made which alone can be found in the MenuSystem repo

## Important

1. To Test Multiplayer every tester needs to have Steam open, with a different Steam account.
2. To be able to find the game session, click settings > downloads > download region, and make sure machines have the same region (Mine is Canada - Vancouver)
